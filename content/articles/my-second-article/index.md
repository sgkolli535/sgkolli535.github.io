## Written for the 2017 AIPF Youth Anthology

There stood a girl.

Her disheveled locks cascaded down her shoulder,

And each breath she drew turned the air colder.

Years of abuse were etched in the scars on her face,

Yet her gown was intricate with the finest of lace.

Depression was imprinted in the hollows of her cheeks,

While her eyes continued to search for what they seek.

Her gaunt arms bore the leaden burden of expectations,

Although she desired not a bit of these aspirations.

Callouses ran through her palms like a river through a valley,

And her fingers curled inwards from the treatment so badly.

Her feet were planted firmly into the ground,

Unlike her spirits of freedom that were unbound.

But with a single flickering of the lights,

The girl vanished just as swiftly as she appeared,

And all that remained was a hollow space within the mirror.
