## How I came up with this title:

The title "loose-leaf" has two equally important definitions. The first meaning is that of a loose leaf paper; the ones pined after by students for scratch paper, quick doodles, and passing notes. The alternate representation is of a lone, or loose, leaf drifting through the wind, flowing freely without obstruction. Both of these ideas emphasize the nature of my creative writing pieces: fleeting and free.
