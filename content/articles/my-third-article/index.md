The taxis filled the streets of the city,  
While the vendors crammed the brimming sidewalks.  
The constant motion and rapid heartbeats  
Only accelerated with no breaks.  
To match the pace of the city,  
A young man sprinted through the crowds.  
His quickening pulse and hasty footsteps  
Posed nothing out of the ordinary,  
But the horde of men pursuing his path proved otherwise.  
"I'll pay you back! I promise!" he exclaimed,  
But to no avail.  
The pursuers showed no signs of stopping,  
Just like the traffic that occupied the roads.  

A single turn brought forth a deserted alleyway.  
Echoes of screams could be heard,  
Which were mingled with the voices of a struggle.  
A few moments passed in silence,  
But they ended with a gunshot that rang for miles.  
The young man's lifeless body  
Was the only immobile piece of the city's puzzle.  

Months passed by from the encounter,  
And a single memento remained of the incident:  
A frayed pair of sneakers dangling from the power line.
