## Referencing Kim Addonizio's "First Poem for You" & Elizabeth Bishop's "I Am in Need of Music" 

Two poems diverge like rays of light seeping through a prism.  
You may not see how they are alike.  
One is whispering about tattoos, skin, and touch,  
While the other pleads for the deep embrace of a song.  
But take a closer look.  
Strip away the unequal stanzas and mismatched meters.  
Peer at the count of the lines  
Or the rhyme schemes hidden behind the phrases,  
And maybe then you will see  
The skeleton of a sonnet buried in them both.  

Fourteen lines, two stanzas, and a volta cutting through,  
Alongside the sharp rhyme scheme and iambic pentameter,  
Undeniably forms a sonnet and pays its dues.  
When music is personified,   
You can feel the deep yearning to be swept away in his arms,   
Or to be lifted with his healing voice,  
And be innocently smitten by all his charms.  
A man that belongs to no one and everyone all at once,  
Yet he is only yours in your heart,  
Because who else could ever make you feel this way,  
Other than music, the most seductive form of art.  

A sonnet need not be cloaked in iambic pentameter  
Or bound into an octave and sestet.  
It can be cracked and recast into something more abstract.  
Something that shows the twists and turns of love  
With enjambment and caesura speeding up the meter  
To mimic a quickening heartbeat drowning in uncertainty.  
Love’s imperfections:   
The permanence, doubt, and distrust  
All poured into a sonnet without a perfect structure.  
An unlikely portrait of love – not an idolization.  

You may be intimidated by sonnets  
And their seemingly unwavering structure,  
But they are more pliable than you think.   
Bending a sonnet to your will --   
Carefully molding the stanzas and meter  
To reach across the page and grab your reader  
Can be the most poignant interpretation of all.  
Pushing the boundaries of what a sonnet can be  
Is the future of these poems that I foresee.
