## Ekphrastic Poem based on Banksy's "Girl with Balloon"

Oh little girl,  
Why do you always try to chase  
the sun as it abandons you over the horizon  
Or capture your faint shadow in an embrace?  
They always tell you to wisen -   
Not everyone is your family,  
And not everyone is your friend.  
Everything everywhere is a calamity.  
In the end, only you can fend  
For yourself. Seeking the good in others  
Does not give you the upper hand.  
Know that no one bothers  
With you, or what you demand.  
There is only one way to get ahead.  
You must be cunning and sly,  
Keeping your eye out as you tread  
Over anyone you may not abide by.  
I can see it in your gentle eyes  
And through your tender heart.  
This is not you.

Put on your pleated dress and patent leather flats.  
Run out the door, as far and fast as your little legs take you.  
The sun you so often look for is cowering behind the clouds.  
A gray cast envelops the water-soaked concrete walls.  
Amongst the ashen landscape you see a tinge of red.  
Molded into a delicate, rounded heart is a balloon.  
You take a few steps forward, cautiously introducing yourself.  
The moment the balloon’s nimble string is in your grasp,  
A gust of wind carries it further away.  
No longer timid with your steps, you take a few proud strides.  
The two of you share a rousing dance –   
Pushing and pulling at each other like the moon and the tides.  
One swift leap, one desperate grasp later,  
Your fingers curl around the slippery balloon truss.  
For a few fleeting moments, you feel proud, at peace,  
But you look up to see the balloon wriggling from your hold.  
This time, you let it go, let it float away untethered.  
The balloon – it’s innocence, its freedom, its wonder –   
Everything is destined to leave.   
So here you are, alone again in the concrete jungle.  
A breeze swells in your year and whispers “There is always hope.”
