I'm a proud ATLien, but after wanting a change of pace, I moved to LA to attend the University of Southern California! Over four impactful years, I majored in Computer Science & Business Administration, immersing myself in a diverse range of subjects including comp sci, SWE, business, and data analytics.

Throughout my undergraduate journey, I gained invaluable experience through internships at PennyMac as a Data Engineer and at Adobe as a Software Engineer (my current position). Beyond coursework, I served as VP for USC's Women in Computing and as Engineering Lead/Consultant for USC startups with TroyLabs. Engaging in hackathons like HackSC and startup incubators such as LavaLab furthered my experience in innovation and entrepreneurship.

Today, as a software engineer at Adobe in the Digital Experience Cloud, I dove into full-stack development with technologies like Typescript, Express, Nest.js, and Angular. I am also exploring AI/ML, crafting a proprietary chatbot feature. While my role primarily involves software development and system architecture, I actively participate in product and design elements, enhancing the holistic impact of my work.

In my free time, I play the bass guitar, powerlift and write poetry!

Last but not least, I've featured a few of my recent poetry works here. Hope you enjoy :)
